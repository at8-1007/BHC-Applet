# BHC-Applet
This project is a Java applet with a Swing-based GUI that provides quotes for hikes for a fictional hiking company. It utilizes Java's Swing toolkit to create and modify controls that the user interacts with. User input is sent to a remote server via a socket connection upon submission, and is processed remotely after which the results are displayed in a readable format.

This project was an assignment for the course "Principles of Enterprise Web Development" (605.681) in the Summer 2018 semester at Johns Hopkins University.
